# Flutter Challenge: Stock Screener
This challenge is designed to assess your understanding of basic Flutter concepts and data fetching in a simulated Fintech environment.

## Objective
Build a mobile application that displays a stock screener with stock data.

## Features:

* Display a list of popular stocks with their company names and current stock prices.
* Allow users to set stocks as favourites for quick access.

## Bonus Features:

* Implement a search bar to filter the displayed stocks by company name.
* Change the background colour of the stock price based on its change (e.g., green for positive change, red for negative change).

## Evaluation Criteria:

* Functionality of displaying pre-defined stock data and refreshing it on demand.
* User interface (UI) design for clear and informative display.
* Code quality and adherence to best practices (e.g., state management).
* Approach to handling bonus features (if attempted).

## How to submit

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Create a pull request to this repository with your solution

## Additional Information:

* **Platform**: Build the app for either iOS or Android.
* **Data source**: You can use a static list of provided stock data in `stocks.json` or a mock API call to simulate data retrieval. (Focus on UI and data handling, not real-time updates).
* **State Management**: Consider using a state management solution like [Stacked](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/), [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) or [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) to manage the stocks.
* **Testing**: While optional, consider writing unit tests for critical functionalities.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on setting up the project and any additional instructions.
* **Real-Time Updates**: While not required, consider how to implement real-time updates using real-time API or WebSocket in the future
* **Version Control with Git**: Utilize Git for version control throughout the development process. Commit your changes regularly, preferably after each significant checkpoint or implementation of a feature. Aim for descriptive commit messages that provide context and clarity to the evaluators.


### Tips:

* Focus on building a clean and functional app with a user-friendly interface.
* Utilize resources like the official Flutter [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) for guidance on state management and data fetching.
* Leverage design resources such as [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [mobbin](https://mobbin.design/) for a polished touch
* Don't hesitate to search online for solutions to specific challenges you encounter related to UI or data handling.
* Be prepared to discuss your approach to data management, UI design decisions, and how you might expand this app to integrate with a real-time API (if time permits).
